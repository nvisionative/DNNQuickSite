## Why Use nvQuickSite?

First of all, because it saves you tons of time...

**Designers & End Users**

This app isn't just for the developers out there. If you test DNN or want to just get a DNN site up and running, just ask your developer friend(s) to get the prerequisites installed and configured. After that, everything you need to know and do is a few simple clicks away.

**Developers**

Even the most seasoned of ASP.NET developers require several minutes to follow the minimum steps necessary to install any web application. This process is time-consuming and error-prone.  This wizard-based app turns that into a couple of moments, without requiring you to open any additional apps.  Use it once, and you'll never again install DNN manually.

## Background
There's been many ways to install DNN over the years, but a cult favorite of many in the community has been and continued to be *MakeDNNSite*, written by Mike van der Muelen.  Unfortunately, Mike has since moved on to other things, and work on his installer had been discontinued. David Poindexter and the [nvisionative](http://www.nvisionative.com) team took this as an opportunity to build a new installer for all of the DNN community to use.  If you liked MakeDNNSite yourself, you'll love nvQuickSite. It has everything good that MakeDNNSite had, and none of the bad.
